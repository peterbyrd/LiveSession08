# LiveSession08

There are six files that were created in this repository:

Hypotenuse Function.R

Angle Function.R

Hypotenuse_and_Angles.html

Hypotenuse_and_Angles.Rmd

Hypotenuse_and_Angles.md

Makefile.R

The two R files create the functions hypot and ang as described below:

Hypot calculates they hypotenuse of a right triangle given the two sides.  The syntax for the function is hypot(a,b) where a is one side and b is the other side.  The function returns the hypotenuse.

Ang calculates the angles of the right triangle given the two sides.  The syntax for the function is ang(a,b) where a is one side and b is the ohter side.  The function returns a vector with all three angles of the triangle.

Hypotenuse_and_Angles.Rmd was used to run the two functions and test that they perform as expected.  This file created the mark down and html files to be used for viewing the results of the functions.

The Makefile will run the two R functions and check the results
