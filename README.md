There are five files that were created in this repository:
Hypotenuse.R
Angle.R
Hypotenuse_Angles.html
Hypotenuse_Angles.RMD
Hypotenuse_Angles.MD

The two R files create the functions hypot and ang as described below:

Hypot calculates they hypotenuse of a right triangle given the two sides.  The syntax for the function is hypot(a,b) where a is one side and b is the other side.  The function returns the hypotenuse.

Ang calculates the angles of the right triangle given the two sides.  The syntax for the function is ang(a,b) where a is one side and b is the ohter side.  The function returns a vector with all three angles of the triangle.
